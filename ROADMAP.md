# GhostForge Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for the GhostForge project. It is subject to change based on community feedback and evolving priorities.

## 1. Integration Testing

While we have comprehensive unit tests, we should now create integration tests that verify the components work together properly:
- Test the full workflow from file indexing to search to analysis
- Test the interaction between the CLI, shell, and analysis components
- Test with various real-world projects to ensure robustness

## 2. Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation for:
- Installation and setup instructions
- User guide for each command and functionality
- Configuration options and customization
- API documentation for developers wanting to extend GhostForge
- Example use cases and tutorials

## 3. LLM Prompt Refinement

Improve the effectiveness of the analysis by:
- Refining the existing prompts based on test results
- Creating specialized prompts for specific technologies and vulnerabilities
- Adding more detailed remediation suggestions
- Optimizing token usage for better performance

## 4. Additional Analysis Features

Expand GhostForge's capabilities:
- **Implement Tiny LLM Filesystem Tool for secure file operations and command execution**
- Add support for cloud infrastructure analysis (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Implement cost optimization analysis
- Add performance optimization suggestions
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- Add custom rule sets for specific enterprise requirements

## 5. User Interface Improvements

Enhance user experience:
- Create a web UI for visualizing analysis results
- Implement interactive reporting dashboards
- Add export functionality to common formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)
- Create a VS Code/IDE extension for in-editor analysis

## 6. Packaging and Distribution

Prepare for wider distribution:
- Ensure proper packaging with setuptools
- Create Docker images for containerized usage
- Set up CI/CD for the GhostForge project itself
- Prepare for PyPI publication
- Create installation scripts for various platforms

## 7. Performance Optimization

Improve speed and efficiency:
- Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Implement caching for common operations
- Parallelize operations where possible
- Reduce memory footprint

## 8. Community Building

Establish a community around the project:
- Create a project website
- Set up communication channels (Discord, forums)
- Define contribution guidelines
- Create roadmap for future development
- Establish governance model for the project

## Priority Timeline

1. **Short-term (1-2 months):**
   - Complete integration tests
   - Create basic documentation
   - Refine LLM prompts
   - **Implement Tiny LLM Filesystem Tool (phase 1-3)**
   - Package for PyPI

2. **Medium-term (3-6 months):**
   - **Complete Tiny LLM Filesystem Tool (phase 4-5)**
   - Add cloud infrastructure analysis
   - Implement dependency scanning
   - Create a web UI
   - Performance optimization

3. **Long-term (6+ months):**
   - VS Code/IDE extensions
   - Community building
   - Enhanced reporting and visualization
   - Custom enterprise integrations

## Implementation Plans

### Tiny LLM Filesystem Tool Implementation

The implementation will proceed in 5 phases:

1. **Phase 1 (1 week):** Core Functionality
   - Implement file read/write operations with path validation
   - Implement directory listing and navigation
   - Basic logging infrastructure

2. **Phase 2 (1 week):** Sandbox & Execution
   - Implement Docker-based sandboxing
   - Command execution with security controls
   - User confirmation system

3. **Phase 3 (1 week):** Git & Advanced Features
   - Git repository operations
   - Dependency management
   - Diffing and patching support

4. **Phase 4 (1 week):** GhostForge Integration
   - Add custom commands to GhostForge shell
   - Configure LLM prompting for tool usage
   - GUI confirmation dialogs (if applicable)

5. **Phase 5 (1 week):** Production Readiness
   - Comprehensive testing and security review
   - Documentation and examples
   - Performance optimization
